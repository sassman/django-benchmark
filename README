This folder contains the benchmark applications for each PHP framework.

Please use the following relative URLs to perform the benchmarking.
You may use the included "benchmark.sh" script to run the benchmarks
automatically.

NOTE: before you run these tests, you may need to run "chmod.sh" to
change directory permissions for some of the benchmarking applications.

If you find any benchmark application that is not properly created,
or if you are interested in adding a new framework to this list,
please log an issue at http://code.google.com/p/phpmark/issues/list
